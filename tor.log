Apr 10 18:25:31.000 [notice] I learned some more directory information, but not enough to build a circuit: We have no usable consensus.

Apr 10 18:25:32.000 [notice] The current consensus has no exit nodes. Tor can only build internal paths, such as paths to onion services.

Apr 10 18:25:32.000 [notice] I learned some more directory information, but not enough to build a circuit: We need more microdescriptors: we have 0/8827, and can only build 0% of likely paths. (We have 0% of guards bw, 0% of midpoint bw, and 0% of end bw (no exits in consensus, using mid) = 0% of path bw.)

Apr 10 18:25:34.000 [notice] The current consensus contains exit nodes. Tor can build exit and internal paths.
